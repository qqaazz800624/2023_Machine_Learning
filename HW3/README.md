# 2023 Machine Learning HW3

## step1
    - Run d11948002_hw3_model1.py ~ run d11948002_hw3_model8.py separately. You can either run them one after another or simultaneously depending on how much the computational resource you have.
    - Remember to change the directory to save checkpoints for models.
## step2
    - Run d11948002_ensemble2_hw3.py to produce ensemble2.csv.

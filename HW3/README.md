# 2023 Machine Learning HW3

## Step1
    - Run d11948002_hw3_model1.py ~ run d11948002_hw3_model11.py separately. 
    - You can either run them one after another or simultaneously depending on how much computational resource you have.
    - Run gradescope_hw3.py and treat it as another model.
    - A warm reminder: Remember to change the directory to save checkpoints for models.
    
## Step2
    - Run d11948002_ensemble2_hw3.py to produce ensemble2.csv.

## Notes
    - After trying many types of model architecture, I would recommend people to try EfficientNet. 
    - There are a series of variants which could do relatively well on image classification task.

# 2023 Machine Learning HW8: Anomaly Detection

I trained two Fully Connected Network (FCN) models and ensembled them.

## Qucik start
    To run my code, simply first run the following three .py files
    - d11948002_hw8_model1.py
    - d11948002_hw8_model2.py

The method I adopted to ensemble is to average three models' loss.

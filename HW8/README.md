# 2023 Machine Learning HW8: Anomaly Detection

I trained three Fully Connected Network (FCN) models and ensembled them.

## Qucik start
    To run my code, simply first run the following three .py files
    - d11948002_hw8_model1.py
    - d11948002_hw8_model2.py
    - d11948002_hw8_model3.py

The method I adopted to ensemble is to average three models' loss using the .py below
    - d11948002_hw8_ensemble.py
